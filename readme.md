## GAME LAUNCHER

The **Game Launcher** is a platform that simplifies the creation of on-chain games on the Internet Computer blockchain. With just **one click**, developers can upload **WebGL**, **PC**, and **Android** builds directly to canister smart contracts. All uploaded games are immediately surfaced on a dedicated discovery page for players to browse and play. 

Game developers have the power to create self-custodial **NFT** and **Token** collections with a single click, alongside launching seamless **airdrops** to thousands of holders. Streamline in-game NFT and Token **minting**, **payments**, **staking**, and **burning** directly from the website.

Deploy a game **World** and configure the contract directly on the Game Launcher website without writing a single line of code. Enforce smart contract laws and empower composability in your game at its inception.

The Game Launcher shortens game development timelines from months to days.
